  I have worked in construction since I was in high school. I'm over it. To this day I do still enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of it. Thinking about how things work in my head excites me. I have an associate's degree in Math/Natural Sciences. It led me to realize how much I enjoy academic excercises. Solving math and physics problems gave me the same thrill I get from fixing things. I want to find this thrill in the world of development. I'm new, and honestly very intimidated by all the different programming languages, libraries, frameworks, etc. I remember this feeling from my ealry days in construction. I learned and became very knowledgable in that field. I can do it here too.
